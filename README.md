## Powered by Latitude


LT2D School provides students and teachers with virtual classrooms. It is an online learning environment where students and teachers interact via audio, video, and sharing apps. Educational institutions use our software to host classes remotely while maintaining the functionality available in a traditional classroom environment.

Features include: 


• Interactive Classroom Environment: Students can communicate face-to-face or over the Internet using voice, text chat, and even video conferencing. Teachers monitor class discussions from anywhere in the world.


• Online Learning: Students complete assignments on their own time; they do not have to wait for lectures or other classes to start. They can take quizzes at any point during the course of the day.


• Collaborative Work: The class is always working together towards a common goal. Everyone has access to all the same resources, including lesson plans, videos, and other materials.
 

Our platform is extensible and we are releasing frequent updates to improve the user experience.
